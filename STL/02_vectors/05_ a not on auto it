for using begin() like functions, we use this type of for loops :

vector<int> vec = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    auto it = vec.begin();
    cout << "The first element is: " << *it << endl;
    cout << "All elements in the vector: ";

    for (it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }

//where we use *it to access elements, whereas
